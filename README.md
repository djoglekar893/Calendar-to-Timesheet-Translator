# Calendar-to-Timesheet-Translator

This code is runnableby following the next few steps listed.
1) make a google spreadsheet that has 2 different sheets in it called "Project" and "Overhead" respectively.
2) Click on "Extensions" to "Apps Script" which will forward you to a page with a bit of code on it
3) Delete that code and copy paste the code attached.
4) Replace the calendar ID on line 33 with your own calendar ID. Make sure you save the program before you run it(control + S),
5) Finally when you run the code, google will ask you to authorize the code, simply click on "Review Permissions" then choose your google account then click on "Advanced" and then click on "Go to Untitled project (unsafe)"(its not actually unsafe), then click on "Allow".

The code should start to run so you should go back to the spreadsheet and there should be a little pop up screen that asks you to enter in your date ranges for the information fetched in google calendar. Finally after entering in the dates, the project work(numbers 1000-15000) will be sorted into the project sheet while the overhead(numbers 0-28) will be sorted in the overhead sheet.

if you have any difficulties, here is a tutorial on how to run the program:
